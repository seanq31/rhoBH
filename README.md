# rhoBH

- This repo implements the procedure proposed in the paper 'A Unified and Optimal Multiple Testing Framework based on $\rho$-values'.
- Here, we calculate all $\rho$-values assuming $N(0,1)$ as their null distributions. Other null distributions are allowed and the $\rho$-BH procedures can be implemented similarly through easy modification.
- When using the parallel computing version of functions, please first use 'registerDoParallel()' to specify the backend support.

- Codes, data and results for generating all the figures in the paper are provided under the folder 'runtime'.
